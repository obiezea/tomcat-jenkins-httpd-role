DevOps is a cultural and technical movement focused on unifying software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration, automation, and continuous delivery. With your knowledge of Ansible for configuration management, Terraform for infrastructure as code, AWS for cloud services, and Red Hat Linux for a stable operating environment, you can leverage these tools to streamline deployment pipelines, automate infrastructure provisioning, and maintain system reliability. This approach not only enhances efficiency but also fosters a collaborative environment where development and operations teams work together seamlessly.
